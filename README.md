I'm a Cyber security student who is passionate about encouraging others like to get in the industry. I enjoy community building, content creation and learning deeply about Java, Python and Cyber threat Intelligence.

I've been working as a Code documentor for the past two months as of 1/08/2025 and I am currently learning about cloud storage hosting, application development and security. I'm brushing off my Program Analytics skills so I can be an effective Developer Advocate in this space. ðŸ˜„
